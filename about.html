      <!-- Section 1: Who I Am -->
      <section class="about-section scroll-reveal">
        <h2 class="command-header">whoami</h2>
        <p>I'm Vladislav Kondratyev, a Computer Science student at UT Dallas and a builder at heart. I enjoy taking ideas from "rough sketch" to working product—whether that's a web app, an AI-powered tool, a game, or a system that makes someone's life easier.</p>

        <p>I grew up with a strong focus on hard work and long-term goals, and that mindset still defines how I approach school, internships, and personal projects. I'm not the loudest person in the room, but I'm consistent, reliable, and serious about the things I commit to.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 2: What I'm Working On -->
      <section class="about-section scroll-reveal">
        <h2 class="command-header">ls -R /mindcore</h2>
        <p>I've been involved in several technical and entrepreneurial projects, including:</p>

        <div class="about-columns">
          <div class="about-column">
            <h3>Real-World Experience</h3>
            <ul class="terminal-list">
              <li>Software engineering internships in cybersecurity and education technology</li>
              <li>Full-stack development for financial tools and web applications</li>
              <li>Contributing to production systems used by real users</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="about-column">
            <h3>Startup & Product Ideas</h3>
            <ul class="mindcore-list">
              <li>
                <strong>EchoMind</strong>
                An AI desktop companion that learns how you work and responds with context and emotional awareness.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>MeteorMate</strong>
                An AI-powered roommate matching system designed to reduce housing stress for students.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SongDNA / Music Tools</strong>
                Tools that help users analyze and discover music based on deeper metrics, not just playlists.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="mt-lg">I'm building these products under a broader ecosystem I call <strong class="accent">MindCore</strong>—a collection of tools designed to understand and enhance how people think, work, and connect.</p>

        <div class="mt-lg">
          <h3>Hackathons & Competitions</h3>
          <p>I regularly participate in university hackathons and tech events, where I get to prototype ideas fast, work with new people, and present under pressure. These experiences constantly push me to improve my communication—explaining complex systems in simple language, writing clear documentation, and presenting ideas to people who may not be technical.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- Section 3: Hobbies & Interests -->
      <section class="about-section scroll-reveal">
        <h2 class="command-header">cat hobbies.txt</h2>
        <p>Outside of coding and classes, I enjoy:</p>

        <div class="about-columns">
          <div class="about-column">
            <ul class="terminal-list">
              <li><strong>Video games and game development</strong> – I like building and playing games, especially ones with strong stories or mechanics.</li>
              <li><strong>Writing & storytelling</strong> – I occasionally write "mini-books" and short pieces for fun, which helps me practice clarity and structure in my communication.</li>
              <li><strong>Soccer & sports</strong> – I enjoy watching and following soccer and NFL games.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="about-column">
            <ul class="terminal-list">
              <li><strong>Music & concerts</strong> – Music helps me focus and reset, and I like going to live events when I can.</li>
              <li><strong>Movies & reading</strong> – I like stories in all formats—books, films, and shows—because they're all about how people think, feel, and change.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 4: Community & Involvement -->
      <section class="about-section scroll-reveal">
        <h2 class="command-header">history | grep "community"</h2>
        <p>At UT Dallas, I've been involved in:</p>

        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li><strong>Student organizations</strong>, including robotics teams and student government roles</li>
          <li><strong>Research & technical projects</strong>, partnering with faculty or small teams on AI and software systems</li>
          <li><strong>Hackathons & campus events</strong>, where I contribute as a participant and team member</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These experiences taught me how to collaborate with different personalities, manage deadlines, and adapt my communication style to the situation—whether I'm sending a formal email, giving a presentation, or coordinating with a team.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 5: How I Work -->
      <section class="about-section scroll-reveal">
        <h2 class="command-header">cat work_style.json</h2>
        <p>A few things that describe my work style:</p>

        <ul class="work-style-list">
          <li>I like <strong>clear expectations</strong> and I communicate openly if something might affect the deadline.</li>
          <li>I'm comfortable with <strong>feedback</strong>—both giving it respectfully and receiving it honestly.</li>
          <li>I try to always be <strong>prepared</strong>: I organize my work, track tasks, and make sure meetings are efficient and focused.</li>
          <li>I care a lot about <strong>professional growth</strong>, not just "finishing assignments."</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Section 6: Where I'm Headed -->
      <section class="about-section scroll-reveal">
        <h2 class="command-header">cat goals.md</h2>
        <p>My long-term goal is to grow into a software engineer and product builder who can:</p>

        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li>Design and ship reliable systems</li>
          <li>Communicate clearly with technical and non-technical stakeholders</li>
          <li>Lead or support teams in building products that solve real problems</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-lg">This portfolio is one step in that direction.</p>
