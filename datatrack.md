Your goals:
To demonstrate your ability to 1) collect data, 2) put data into a coherent form, 3) visualize the data, and 4) draw conclusions/insight from the data.

Steps:

Gather your weekly emails from Grammarly. The minimum to be analyzed is 5 but you should include more. If you have access to data that is more interesting/relevant to you, you can use that instead of Grammarly. You might use data from your phone that tracks how much time you spent on a particular app, how much you slept, or how much you moved your body during the day. Cross-referencing your data with sleep, or daily calendar, or phone usage is not required, but you may get more interesting results.

Create a spreadsheet and enter the data.
 
Complete this LinkedIn Learning course and watch/use instructions in this video about graphing in Excel: https://youtu.be/eHtZrIb0oWY

4. Use Excel - or some other tool - to convert the spreadsheet data into visuals (charts, graphs, tables, etc) and provide the reader with a description of what the visuals show. For example, here’s how one person took their data and converted it to make visual sense. I recommend you try Think Cell, which is free to you as UTD student. More information HERE!


On your POP, do the following to share your Data Tracking work on the Projects page:
include 2 or 3 screenshots of Excel and data visualizations
write 3-4 paragraphs in which you walk the reader through HOW you collected and visualized the data and WHAT your takeaways/insights/conclusions are



You will be receiving peer feedback on a draft of this assignment. See course calendar for the date of the in-class workshop.

## Completed Data Tracking Write-Up

### Objective
Show ability to collect longitudinal development data, organize it cleanly, visualize trends, and extract actionable insights.

### Data Collected
I tracked yearly: total GitHub commits, number of distinct projects started, and number of programming languages actively used. These three metrics together portray consistency (commits), initiative/output (projects), and breadth (language adoption). Source references: GitHub annual summaries, local project folders with year tags, and repository language metadata.

### Structure & Tools
All values were entered into a simple spreadsheet table: Year | Commits | Projects | Languages. Excel (and a lightweight charting plugin) generated the visuals. I prioritized clarity: legible axis labels, no 3D effects, restrained color use, and descriptive captions. The charts are exported as PNG and embedded on the Projects page.

### Visualizations
1. Commits Per Year (Line) – Reveals acceleration phases and plateaus.
2. Projects Started (Columns) – Highlights years of experimentation vs consolidation.
3. Languages Used (Cumulative / Stepped) – Shows diversification without implying exponential growth.

### Narrative & Insights
Early years: modest commit volume while fundamentals were forming. Mid period: simultaneous spike in commits and projects indicates a shift from dabbling to shipping—languages expand purposefully during this phase (each added for a concrete problem, not novelty).

Recent year: commits remain high while new project count levels slightly—intentional pivot from starting more to refining existing work. That balance reduces abandoned code and increases maintainability. Language count growth slows, suggesting a maturity phase: deeper mastery over constant expansion.

Actionable takeaway: maintain a cap on new project starts; reinvest time into documentation, testing, and performance. Future tracking will add quality metrics (e.g., test coverage, issues closed) to complement volume.

### Conclusion
The data converts a general feeling of progress into concrete evidence: sustained output, deliberate technology adoption, and healthier pacing. This lightweight annual framework is reusable for other skill dimensions (open‑source contributions, learning targets). It encourages strategic focus instead of chasing raw counts.

### Next Iteration Plan
Peer feedback will be used to refine captions (ensure each chart answers “What changed?” + “Why it matters”) and possibly integrate a rolling 3‑year moving average for commits to smooth noise.
