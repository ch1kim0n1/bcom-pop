        <p>Where possible, I've included a brief overview and reflection on what I learned.</p>

      <div class="project-modal-body">
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, I drafted a professional email to a business contact (for example, a manager, recruiter, or potential partner). The goal was to communicate clearly, respectfully, and concisely while using proper business email format and tone.</p>

        <div class="project-embed">
          <p><em>[Your email embed or image would be placed here]</em></p>
          <p>You can embed a PDF viewer, image, or screenshot of your actual email.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>I treated the email like a real-world interaction:</p>
        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li>I used a clear subject line that made the purpose obvious.</li>
          <li>I opened with a polite, specific greeting instead of something generic.</li>
          <li>I quickly stated why I was reaching out, what I was asking for, and why it mattered.</li>
          <li>I closed with appreciation, a clear next step, and a professional sign-off.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection: What I Learned</h3>
        <p>This activity showed me how much <strong>tone and structure</strong> matter. Even a small email can either show professionalism or create confusion. I learned to:</p>
        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li>Avoid unnecessary filler and get to the point</li>
          <li>Make my requests specific and easy to respond to</li>
          <li>Respect the reader's time while still sounding human and friendly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are skills I use regularly now when emailing professors, coworkers, and collaborators.</p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>In the Data Tracking activity, I collected, organized, and visualized data related to a business or communication topic. The main goal was to turn raw numbers into a visual story—and then explain what those numbers actually mean.</p>

        <div class="project-embed">
          <p><em>[Your chart/graph or data visualization would be placed here]</em></p>
          <p>You can embed an image of your chart or an interactive visualization.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>My Approach</h3>
        <p>I focused on:</p>
        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li>Choosing a chart type that made the data easiest to understand</li>
          <li>Labeling clearly so the reader doesn't have to guess what they're looking at</li>
          <li>Writing a short explanation that answered: "So what?"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instead of just saying, <em>"Here are the numbers,"</em> I tried to say, <em>"Here's what we should do or think based on these numbers."</em></p>

        <h3>Reflection: What I Learned</h3>
        <p>This activity helped me practice <strong>data storytelling</strong>, not just data display. I learned to:</p>
        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li>Think about my audience first—what they care about and what decisions they might make</li>
          <li>Highlight the key trend instead of overwhelming the reader with every detail</li>
          <li>Use visuals as a support tool for communication, not a replacement for it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the same skills you need in real projects: tracking metrics, explaining performance, and making recommendations.</p>

      <div class="project-modal-body">
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>For the Team Presentation, our group prepared and delivered a professional presentation on a business-related topic (such as a case study, a strategy recommendation, or an analysis of a real company situation). We had to coordinate slides, speaking roles, and timing as a team.</p>

        <div class="project-embed">
          <p><em>[Your slide deck or key slides would be embedded here]</em></p>
          <p>You can embed a PDF of the slides, Google Slides, or images of key slides.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>In the team, I helped with:</p>
        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li>Structuring the overall flow: introduction, problem, analysis, recommendation, conclusion</li>
          <li>Designing slides that were clean, visual, and not overloaded with text</li>
          <li>Practicing transitions between speakers so the presentation felt unified</li>
          <li>Delivering my portion clearly and staying within the time limit</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection: What I Learned</h3>
        <p>This assignment strengthened my <strong>team communication and presentation</strong> skills. I learned to:</p>
        <ul class="terminal-list">
          <li>Balance individual responsibility with group coordination</li>
          <li>Give and receive feedback on slide design and speaking style</li>
          <li>Speak in a way that is professional but still natural and engaging</li>
          <li>Handle nerves by preparing thoroughly and practicing out loud</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These experiences translate directly to real-world projects, where you have to present ideas, persuade stakeholders, and represent your team professionally.</p>
